## Overview
This is for my high level backlog, when I start working on something, it goes into an xxx_plan.md, and when it is done I move that md to the archived_plans folder and update this list (if it is on this list).


## Halloween Use Cases
- Take a picture of the trick or treaters, send it to the LLM, and then have it come back and say something about their costumes over the speaker
- Visitors can talk with the robot (make voice interactions better)
- Remote controlled voice to speech (updated to new controller)
- Add lights / moving elements to the robot and animate / pupeteer them

## General use cases
- Tune pids, joystick control
- Nav
